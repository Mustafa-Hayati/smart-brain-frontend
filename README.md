# Smart Brain Frontend

I created this app using [Andrei Neagoie's](https://github.com/aneagoie)  **Zero To Mastery Course** course. I changed it a little bit to **recognize multiple faces**. I also unistalled the clarifai package from the frontend, so if you clone this repo, be sure to install it when you're checking out previous commits.
I also did'nt deploy it to heroku, because I have already done deploying on heroku a few times so I skipped that part. If you want to deploy it to heroku be sure to change all the addresses.
